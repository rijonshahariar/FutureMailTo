# Dear Dad: A Son's Letter That Every Father Should Read

Men aren't great at expressing feelings. We're taught to be strong, to fix problems rather than talk about them, to show love through actions rather than words.

But sometimes words matter. Sometimes Dad needs to hear exactly what he means to us, even if it feels awkward to say out loud.

This letter is for every son who loves his father but hasn't quite found the way to tell him. And for every father wondering if his son sees him at all.

**Dear Dad,**

I've been meaning to talk to you about some things, but every time we're together, we end up discussing sports scores or car trouble or whatever project you're working on. So I'm writing it down instead.

First, I want to tell you that I noticed more than you think.

I noticed when you were exhausted but still threw the ball with me in the backyard. I noticed when you worked overtime so I could play on that travel team. I noticed when you gave up things you wanted so we could have things we probably didn't even need.

At the time, I was a kid. I didn't get it. But I get it now.

You never made a big deal of any of it. That's kind of your style, isn't it? Just do what needs to be done without expecting applause. I used to think that meant you didn't care about recognition. Now I realize it means you cared about us more than yourself.

I remember watching you work. You fixed things. You built things. You figured out problems that seemed impossible to me. I'd sit there with my kid brain thinking, "Dad can do anything." Honestly, part of me still thinks that.

But here's what really stuck with me: I watched how you treated people. The way you shook hands with everyone like they mattered. How you never raised your voice at waiters or customer service people, even when things went wrong. The respect you showed Mom even during arguments.

I'm still learning how to be that kind of man. I'm not always good at it. But I know what to aim for because you showed me.

There are things I wish I could take back. The times I pushed you away as a teenager. The years I thought I knew everything and you knew nothing. The moments I was too cool to hang out with you.

I was an idiot. I know you know this already, but I needed to say it.

Can we talk about the tough stuff too? I know it wasn't always easy between us. We're similar in ways that sometimes create friction. Both stubborn. Both convinced we're right. Both terrible at admitting when we're wrong.

Maybe I inherited that from you. Or maybe all fathers and sons are like this. Either way, I want you to know that even when we butted heads, I never doubted that you loved me. Not once.

I know you worried about me. You still do, probably. You hide it behind advice and practical questions, but I see it. "How's work going?" means "Are you okay?" "Is the car running well?" means "Are you safe?" Took me way too long to learn your language.

Here are some things I should have told you years ago:

Thank you for teaching me to work hard. I still hear your voice in my head when I want to quit. "Finish what you start." I hate it sometimes. But it's made me better.

Thank you for letting me fail. You could have fixed things for me. Saved me from consequences. But you let me fall and learn and grow. That was love, even when it didn't feel like it.

Thank you for being present. You weren't always perfect, but you were there. Games. Recitals. Those endless school projects. You showed up. A lot of dads don't. I never had to wonder if you'd be in the audience.

Thank you for the quiet moments. Fishing without talking. Driving without the radio on. Just existing in the same space. Those might be my favorite memories.

And thank you for still being you. I know getting older isn't easy. I see you slowing down a little, though you'd never admit it. But you're still the guy who taught me to ride a bike. Still the guy I call when something breaks and I have no idea what to do.

Here's something you might not know: I brag about you. To friends. To coworkers. When people complain about their fathers, I stay quiet because I don't have complaints. When people share war stories about terrible dads, I have nothing to contribute.

I got lucky. I know not everyone does. And I don't take it for granted.

One more thing, and this is the hardest to write.

I'm scared of losing you. Not soon, hopefully. But one day. The thought of a world without you in it is something I can't really process. You've always been there. The idea that you won't be forever is just... I can't think about it too long.

So I'm writing this now, while we still have time. While you can read it and know how I feel. While I can tell you in whatever awkward way I'm capable of that you matter to me more than I ever express.

I love you, Dad. Not just because you're my father. Because of who you are. Because of the man you've been and the man you're still becoming. Because you made me feel safe and seen and valued.

I hope I become half the father you've been if I ever have kids of my own.

Until then, I'm just your son. Grateful, proud, and probably still not calling as often as I should.

Love,
[Your Son]

## Why Sons Should Write to Their Fathers

Men communicate differently than women. We're not worse at it, just different. Writing can bridge the gap when speaking feels too vulnerable.

Letters give us time to think. Time to revise. Time to express things that get stuck in our throats when we're face-to-face.

And here's the thing: fathers need to hear it. They might not ask. They might wave off compliments. But knowing their sons see them and appreciate them? That matters more than most men will ever admit.

## If This Feels Awkward

Yeah, it probably is. That's fine.

You don't have to write something this long. You don't have to share it in person. You can use FutureMailTo to send it on Father's Day or his birthday. You can leave it as a card. You can just email it with "Hey, read this when you have a sec."

The delivery method doesn't matter. The words do.

## For Fathers Reading This

If you're a dad hoping your son feels this way, here's my guess: he probably does. Sons aren't great at expressing it. But the love is there, even when it's hiding behind teenage attitude or adult busyness.

Keep being you. Keep showing up. The impact you're making is bigger than you'll ever fully see.
